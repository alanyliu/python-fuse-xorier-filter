# Fused XORier Filter in Python

The Fused XORier filter (FXLT) is a static probabilistic data structure that incorporates spatial coupling, linear construction time, and hash caching to extend the Bloomier filter. Also included are implementations of related filters, such as the XOR filter and binary fused filter.
