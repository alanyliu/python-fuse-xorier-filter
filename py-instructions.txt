--- Instructions for running the prelimFilters.py and fusedXorier.py scripts ---

prelimFilters.py

Run the Python script in a virtual environment with the necessary imports. The output produces two plots, one for
build time vs. filter size and the other for build time vs. number of keys.


fusedXorier.py

Run the Python script in a virtual environment with the necessary imports. The output produces results from testing
the fused XORier filter on the AOL dataset with reported filter size-number of key ratio, build time, and false-positive
rate for sample parameters. It also produces a plot of build time vs. number of keys for various input sizes ranging
from 250K to 3M.
